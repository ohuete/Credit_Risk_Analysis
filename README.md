# Credit Risk Analysis
## Purpose & Background
In this project, I utilize machine learning to determine how effective this method may be when identifying credit card risk. As we know, the credit risk problem is inherently unbalanced, meaning good loans outnumber risky loans. I used anumber of different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Some techniques used were RandomOverSampler and SMOTE to compare oversampling models and ClusterCentroids for undersampling. SMOTEEN was also useed in undersampling and over sampling models. Lastly, I utilized the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier algorithims, which focused on reducing bias. 

## Results
The following is a list of the results from the machine learning techniques used with images. 

**RandomOverSampler**
From the image below, we see that the accuracy score is about 64.5% and low risk detection is high while high risk detection is low.
